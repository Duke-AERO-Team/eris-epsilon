# Eris Epsilon PCB
Eris Epsilon is the 5th version of Duke AERO's SRAD flight computer ERIS.

## Usage
This year, we are switching to KiCAD for PCB design. Previous years have used Eagle. The Eagle files and datasheet for ERIS Delta are available in the Google Drive under `2024/2025 Aero>Avionics>Eris Delta`.
